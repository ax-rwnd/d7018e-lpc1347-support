# Project: lpc1347-support crate
A support crate for the LPC1347 breakout board.

Most tasks, both simple and complex, rely on common hardware to be available to the programmer. Tor new users to be able to use said hardware, drivers and hardware-support need to be available from the get-go, which is currently not the case for rust on the LPC1347.

## Grade 3
Provide GPIO-, RTFM and PWM support for the LPC1347.
